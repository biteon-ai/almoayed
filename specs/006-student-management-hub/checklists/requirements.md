# Specification Quality Checklist: Teacher Student Management Hub

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-07-22  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation pass (iteration 1): Spec stays product-facing; requested Server Actions / file paths / component names are deferred to `/speckit-plan` and `/speckit-implement`.
- Assumptions lock unlink-vs-hard-delete, default free/active, and coexistence with TEACH-002/004 so no clarification blockers remain.
- Mild product surface references (`/teacher/students`, RTL) match existing Al-Moayed specs and are acceptable.
